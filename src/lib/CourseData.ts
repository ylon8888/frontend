      question: "What is photosynthesis?",
      answer:
        "Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants and some other organisms use sunlight to synthesize foods with carbon dioxide and water. Photosynthesis in plants generally involves the green pigment chlorophyll and generates oxygen as a by-product.",
    },
    {
      question: "Why is photosynthesis important?",
      answer:
        "Photosynthesis is crucial because it is the primary process that converts solar energy into chemical energy, providing the base for almost all food chains on Earth. It also produces oxygen, which is essential for most life forms, and helps regulate atmospheric carbon dioxide levels.",
    },
    {
      question: "What is the carbon cycle?",
      answer:
        "The carbon cycle is the biogeochemical cycle by which carbon is exchanged among the biosphere, pedosphere, geosphere, hydrosphere, and atmosphere of the Earth. It is the process through which carbon atoms continually travel from the atmosphere to the Earth and then back into the atmosphere.",
    },
    {
      question: "How does human activity affect the carbon cycle?",
      answer:
        "Human activities such as burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial processes release large amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. This disrupts the natural carbon cycle by increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations, which contributes to global warming and climate change.",
    },
    {
      question: "What are greenhouse gases and why are they important?",
      answer:
        "Greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide, trap heat in Earth's atmosphere. They are important because they help maintain Earth's temperature at levels suitable for life. However, human activities have increased their concentrations, leading to enhanced greenhouse effect and global warming.",
    },
    {
      question:
        "How does the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere affect climate change?",
      answer:
        "Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas that traps heat in the atmosphere. As CO2 levels increase due to human activities, more heat is trapped, leading to global warming. This warming affects weather patterns, sea levels, and ecosystems, collectively known as climate change.",
